# What is the physical layer?

Ultimately, the internet is physical, material. So we have all these computers
lying around. They're all over the world, and we want them all to talk to each
other.

Before we can do anything, we have to make sure they can send physical signals to each
other. How can we do this?

These days, the internet probably comes to you through the air.
Probably from the WiFi router closest to you. Maybe from the cell tower closest to your phone. If you're very rich, or live in a very remote place, perhaps the internet comes to you by satalite.
But these are last-mile solutions.


> If you were using the internet in the 90s, you'll remember not being able to get online when someone was talking on the phone, and vice versa. That's because, in those days, the internet traveled through the same physical media as the phone: copper wire. A modem (modulator/demodulator) turned data packets into sounds. You could [quite literally hear it "dialing up"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0) when it connected to the broader internet.

Undersea cables carry between 95 and 99% of all internet traffic (Starosielski,
2015; Sherman, 2021). About ten trillion US dollars depend on them (Vatanparast,
2020; Starosielski, 2015). They're hugely impactful to infrastructure providers
and end-users alike (Liu et al, 2020).
