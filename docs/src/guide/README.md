# Introduction

The thesis of this book is that the internet is, broadly speaking, insecure and
prone to collapse. The purpose of this book is to describe why *exactly* this is
the case---what particular attacks threaten the internet's stability globally.

What to do about these issues is outside the scope of this book (though g
certainly make my own opinions on the matter known; see [...]). This is a
reference text primarily. It seeks to inform, drawing on rich and old bodies of
work, about these risks: where they come from, how they work, and what their
impact might be.
